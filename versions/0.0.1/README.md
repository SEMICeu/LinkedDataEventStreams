# The Linked Data Event Streams specification

A Linked Data Event Stream is a collection of immutable objects (such as version objects, sensor observations or archived representation). Each object is described in RDF.

The objective of a Linked Data Event Stream is to allow consumers to replicate all of its items and to stay in sync when items are added.

This specification uses [TREE](https://w3id.org/tree/specification) for its collection and fragmentation features, which in its turn is compatible to other specifications such as Activity Streams, DCAT-AP, LDP or Shape Trees.
